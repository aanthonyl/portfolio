<p>I worked with two species, Lonicera sempervirens, also known as Coral Honeysuckle and Erythrina herbacea, also known as Cherokee Bean.</p>
<p>Lonicera sempervirens

</p>
<p>Erythrina herbacea
<figure><img src="/images/cure/eryth.jpg">
</figure>
</p>
<p>I created R scripts that looked at their environmental variables based on where these species were distributed. Based on a few models predicting environmental variables in the coming 20-80 years with climate change, I generated niche maps that showed species suitability.</p>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; justify-content: flex-start; margin-left: 5%;">

  <img src="/portfolio/images/cure/Lonicera_sempervirens_cleaned_map.png" style="width: 70%;">
</div>
<p>These maps above show their current distribution as of 2024 when I collected this data. The maps below their current habitat suitability.</p>

  <img src="/images/cure/erythrina.png" style="width: 70%;">
</div>
<p>This photo below shows future habitat sustainability in the United States. Both species are predicted to do poorly in their endemic
regions. Erythrina herbacea does not seem to have a new area it can find a niche in the United States,
possibly being able to survive if it moves closer towards the great lakes, however it has very low habitat
suitability everywhere, especially in its endemic area. Lonicera sempervirens has a better chance of
surviving in the future, with lots of areas with higher habitat suitability in the northeastern and
northwestern United States.

<p>Here&rsquo;s my poster in better detail! This was made for a symposium before we finished collecting all of our data and drawing our conclusions for the two species, so please check out <a href="/files/FinalReportAnthonyLiao.pdf" target="_blank">this report linked</a> if you are interested.</p>
