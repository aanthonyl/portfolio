Hi! I&rsquo;m Anthony Liao, a student at the University of Florida. I will be graduating in May 2025 with a bachelor&rsquo;s in computer science.
I also have minors in electrical engineering, botany, digital arts and science, and an engineering certificate in AI fundamentals and applications.
During my undergraduate studies, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of time to explore different disciplines, work on projects across various fields, and discover ways connect to them together. I love making things with my own hands, and I&rsquo;ve found a love for working with robotics and projects that blend hardware and software together. The past couple years I&rsquo;ve worked extensively within ROS environments, and I am excited to learn more wherever I end up. Please check out my projects page to see what I&rsquo;ve done!">

<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Anthony Liao, a student at the University of Florida. I will be graduating in May 2025 with a bachelor&rsquo;s in computer science.
I also have minors in electrical engineering, botany, digital arts and science, and an engineering certificate in AI fundamentals and applications.</p>
<p>During my undergraduate studies, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of time to explore different disciplines, work on projects across various fields, and discover ways connect to them together.

<p>Outside of my studies, I really enjoy reading science fiction, fencing, and rock climbing. I&rsquo;m currently reading through Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s works, and my favorite series so far has been the Three Body Problem series. I also really love camping, hiking, and traveling; I&rsquo;m planning a backpacking trip over a break in my semester. I&rsquo;ve studied in Japan at Kyoto University and have been to China many times throughout my life. I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for more exciting adventures!</p>
