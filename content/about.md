Hi! I'm Anthony Liao, a student at the University of Florida. I will be graduating in May 2025 with a bachelor's in computer science.
I also have minors in electrical engineering, botany, digital arts and science, and an engineering certificate in AI fundamentals and applications. 

During my undergraduate studies, I've had a lot of time to explore different disciplines, work on projects across various fields, and discover ways connect to them together. I love making things with my own hands, and I've found a love for working with robotics and projects that blend hardware and software together. The past couple years I've worked extensively within ROS environments, and I am excited to learn more wherever I end up. Please check out my projects page to see what I've done!


Outside of my studies, I really enjoy reading science fiction, fencing, and rock climbing. I'm currently reading through Isaac Asimov's works, and my favorite series so far has been the Three Body Problem series. I also really love camping, hiking, and traveling; I'm planning a backpacking trip over a break in my semester. I've studied in Japan at Kyoto University and have been to China many times throughout my life. I'm always on the lookout for more exciting adventures!
