This game I made with a team of four while studying abroad in Japan for two months. For this class however, we were not allowed to use Unity, so this entire game is built with python with the Arcade library. We used a paid small asset pack, and coded everything and created simple animations for it.

The premise of the game is pretty simple- it's a 2D level based Metroidvania platformer with a few levels with enemies and a couple boss fights. I had a lot of fun making this despite the limitations of using the Arcade library. Here are some screenshots from our presentation on the game!

If you want to try out our game, in any terminal that has python in it run these commands:

~~~python
pip install robot_rumble
play_robot_rumble
~~~
