I started volunteering here in 2023 after I found out that UF has a sustainable agriculture farm. The Field and Fork Farm is connected to the <a href="https://pantry.fieldandfork.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Hitchcock Pantry</a>, and provides fresh and organic produce for people at UF experiencing food insecurity.

I've been working as an intern here, managing the Composting and The International Forest Gardens, along with doing other regular tasks such as harvesting, planting, and weeding. Working here, I've learned a lot of skills and gained a lot of experience that I would have never had otherwise, or gotten the chance to pick up. I feel very lucky to have worked here!

How the compost starts versus how it ends up

The composting system on our farm is large for the farm's size and is used to amend the soil before we plant into it. We have a hot composting system, which I regularly monitor the temperature and conditions for. We get food scraps, plants coming out of the field, wood chips from utilities, and bat guano from our bat houses on the farm. Combining all of these creates very rich compost. We're passionate about reducing food waste, so having this system on our farm is amazing.

The International Forest Garden is a forested trail area we have in the back of our farm with many more perennial plants. While the farm beds grow annual crops, the Forest Garden has many perennial fruit trees and crops, such as peaches, muscadine grapes, figs, loquat, mulberry, ginger, and so much more. These must be maintained differently, so pruning, weeding, and other managements are done  to upkeep the forest. I've also focused a lot on the removal of invasive plants, specifically air potato and cat's claw in Florida.

I have a passion for growing and eating vegetables (haha), so I've been very grateful for this experience, and I think it makes up a fundamental part of who I am. I'm always excited to learn more and grow my knowledge!
