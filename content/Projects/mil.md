<a href="https://mil.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">The Machine Intelligence Lab</a> is a UF research lab that focuses on development of intelligent, autonomous robots. While I worked here, we focused primarily on two competitions- <a href="https://robosub.org/" target="_blank">RoboSub</a> and <a href="https://robotx.org/" target="_blank">RobotX</a>. We worked mainly on two autonomous robots:

I've worked on tasks for the lab related to the competitions with creating in-house drivers, competition challenges, and working on various programs. I've learned a lot from working here, and hope to work in a related field in the future. Check out the links above for more details about our robots and our lab.
