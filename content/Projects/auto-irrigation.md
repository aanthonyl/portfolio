While working on the Field and Fork Farms, I wanted to use my technical background to create a system that would make tasks on the farms easier, one of them being managing irrigation. Currently on the farm, irrigation is semi-manual, by setting timers in person on the farm that controls a schedule for the irrigation.

The premise of this project is to use capacitive soil moisture sensors to determine when it is best to water the fields. Using measures of moisture, temperature, and light, we want to use this data to turn on and off a solenoid valve, and send all this data to an online dashboard where data can be monitored and valves can be controlled. With remote irrigation, no one needs to be on the farm to monitor the irrigation, and no one will have to manually turn it off during times of heavy rain or wet periods.

Here's some of the hardware we've been testing with.
